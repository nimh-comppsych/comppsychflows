# CompPsychFlows
Our lab's repository of nipype interfaces and workflows. Obviously inspired by the Poldrack Lab's [NiWorkflows](https://github.com/nipreps/niworkflows).

Currently there is only one commandline script, comppsychflows-mnitobold

## comppsychflows-mnitobold
Not implemented yet, but it will do the following:
take a subject's bids directory and an fmriprep output
produce a working directory with head motion corrected bold series and an MNI template and parcellation transformed to that space with the suceptibility distortion correction transformation.
